## General Introduction


## User Experience

### Target Audience
* General population
* Think of another one

### User Stories
* New user:
	i. I am a new user and I would like to check the weather.
	ii. I am a new user and I would like an application with a easy navigable user experience.

* Existing user:
	i. I am an existing user and I would like to easily check the weather
	ii. I am an existing user and I would like a UI that is easy navigable.
	

* Site developer:
	i. I want to make the website interactive and a user friendly UI.
	ii. I want to make the application easy to for users to enjoy.

### Strategy 
The strategy is to create an interactive weather application that displays the weather data in an clear and concise way. To create an application that provides
a consistency in styling across the application. To create code that allows for ease when implementing future updates and features.

### Project Goals
* To provide an interactive application.
* Allows for users to query weather forecast.
* To provide an application that has good UX design.

### Future Works
Futures works will include:
* Implementing a live weather map to visually view weather based on location. 
* Implement a more detailed weather description based on day of week.
* Implement a "Find my Location" button using Geolocaton. 


## Design Brief
The main aim of Meditate is create a webpage that will encourage users to be more concious of their mental health in the form of Meditation/Mindfulness. Another aim of the site is to provide simplistic, quick exercises for users to preform at home. For the basic design principle of the site was to keep it simplistic, easy to read information. The flow of the web site follows that trend of simplicity and calmness with it's colours and fonts. Below I have included my reasoning for choosing my font and colours for the project. 


Colours:
The justification for my choice the colours below are inline with the overall design flow. I chose to use a circular radial-gradient css function as it would allow me to use multiple shades of blue and would create a smooth transition from one colour to the next.
* Background colour - #1c7fc2, #009cdc, #0d9ade, #011844. 


Wireframe Diagrams:
Before beginning the project I created 3 wireframe diagrams using the wireframe software Balsamiq. Below are links to the wireframe diagrams that the were used in development.  
* [Desktop](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/My-Weather/blob/main/Project_2_Wireframes/wireframe2.bmpr)
* [Mobile](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/wireframes/wireframe3_mobile.bmpr)


Fonts:
The fonts that are used in the project are from the Google Fonts library. Initially, I chose to use Open Sans and Quicksand, but after viewing the font in development I changed my mind and decided to use Noto Sans and Red Hat Mono. 

* All heading tags - Noto Sans sans-serif.
* All p tags - Red Hat Mono, sans-serif.


Images:
* There are both icons and images that are used throughtout the application. The icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). All images are from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions).

-->

## Issues
There were no major issues in the development of this application.

## Testing
* For the testing portion of this project, I used W3C HTML Validation Service to validate my HTML, and again I used W3C CSS Validation to validate my CSS. Below I have linked the screenshots of my error free [HTML](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/test_screenshots/HTML_Validation.png) and [CSS](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/test_screenshots/CSS_Validation.png). 

## Deployment

### Local Deployment
* Assuming you are using Gitpod, download the gitpod extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gitpod/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search).
* Return to my github repository.
* On the upper right corner of the repository there is a green "Gitpod" button, click it, this will take you to Gitpod.
* Create an account if you do not have one, otherwise login.
* Github may ask you to authorize Gitpod. Click "Authorize gitpod-io
* Gitpod will now open the repository.

### Remote Deployment
* Visit my Github Repository.
* On the repository ribbon navigate to the "settings" tab.
* On the left of the screen, navigate to the "Code and automation" section.
* In the "Code and automation" section, click on the "Pages" button.

### Cloning / Forking
#### Cloning
* Navigate to the main page of the repository. 
* Above the file display/structure of the repository on the top right, click the green "Code" dropdown.
* To clone using HTTPS, copy the link using the clipboard icon. See [image](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/My-Weather/blob/main/assets/images/github_screenshots/cloning-repo%20.png) for reference on where to find the link to clone.
* Open a terminal/command prompt window.
* Create a folder to the location where you want to store the cloned repository. 
* In the terminal type, and press enter.

#### Forking
