## General Introduction
With the current situtation with people working from home, many are unable to detatch from work stresses and their mental health takes affect. The idea behind this application is to bring awareness to the benefits of meditation, and provide the user with some beginner exercises to to introduce them to meditation. There is also a calender for the user to come join in person for a group meditation class. 

## User Experience
The target audience of this project is anyone who has an interest in Meditation or is looking to give Meditation a try. 

The target audience of Meditate of this project is anyone who has an interest in Meditation. The aim of Meditate is to bring interest to those who don't know a lot about meditation. For those who already have a good understanding of how we are affecting our oceans they should still be able to learn a little and understand what we are aiming to achieve with spreading knowledge.

### Future Works
Futures works will include:
* Implementing a live weather map to visually view weather based on location.
* Implement a more detailed weather description based on day of week

## Design Brief
The main aim of Meditate is create a webpage that will encourage users to be more concious of their mental health in the form of Meditation/Mindfulness. Another aim of the site is to provide simplistic, quick exercises for users to preform at home. For the basic design principle of the site was to keep it simplistic, easy to read information. The flow of the web site follows that trend of simplicity and calmness with it's colours and fonts. Below I have included my reasoning for choosing my font and colours for the project. 

Images: 
* All [images](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io/tree/main/assets/images/wireframes) that I used in the development of this project are from [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.ie/). This project is based off of the design of both wireframe 2 and wireframe 3. 


Colours:
The justification for my choice the colours below are inline with the overall design flow. I chose to stick to Blue / off Blue colours as these colors having a calming, and are proven to decrease the heart rate, lower blood pressure and reduce anxiety levels. I have included the colours below along with they're corresponding hex values.
* Background colour - #e9fcff
* Background colour of calender - #8c918f


Wireframe Diagrams:
Before beginning the project I created 3 wireframe diagrams using the wireframe software Balsamiq. Below are links to the wireframe diagrams that the were used in development.  
* [Desktop](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/wireframes/wireframe_3.bmpr)
* [Mobile](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/wireframes/wireframe3_mobile.bmpr)

Fonts:
The fonts that I chose are from the Google Fonts library. I chose to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as there is a better selection of fonts/ font styles compared to other libraries. Below I have included the fonts that were used in the project.

* All heading tags - Mochiy Pop P One, sans-serif.
* All p tags - Quicksand, sans-serif.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ mkdir folder
$ cd folder
$ git clone https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io.git
```
-->

## Issues
There are two issues in this project:

* When the background color was applied to the calender section, it shows the outline of the divs that hold the divs of the days of the week. Unfortunately I have be unable to fix this issue, so far, but plan on adding bootstrap to the calender to correct this background color issue. - FIXED

* Another issue that I encountered was with the images when reducing the sizes to make it compatible on mobile devices. In the near future I plan on moving the images above or below the exercise block of text. - FIXED

## Testing
* For the testing portion of this project, I used W3C HTML Validation Service to validate my HTML, and again I used W3C CSS Validation to validate my CSS. Below I have linked the screenshots of my error free [HTML](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/test_screenshots/HTML_Validation.png) and [CSS](https://github.com/Gavin-1001/Gavin-1001.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/test_screenshots/CSS_Validation.png).
